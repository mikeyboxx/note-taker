# Notes Taker

## Description

This application allows business owners to write and save notes, so that they can organize and keep track of tasks that they need to complete.  The user is initially presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. 

The notes page has existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column. When the user enters a new note title and the note’s text, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page. If user clicks on the Save icon then the new note entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes. If the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column then that note appears in the right-hand column.  By clicking on the Write icon, represented by a '+' in the navigation at the top of the page, the data entry fields get erased, so that the user can enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
